## Results and conclusions



## Obstacles found



## Lessons learnt



## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should have been pushed to my Github repo for this chapter.

* **A cleaned CSV data file** containing the results of my data wrangling work.
* **A Jupyter Notebook (data-wrangling.ipynb)** containing all Python code and commands used in the importing, cleaning, manipulation, and exporting of your data set.
* **The current ``README.md`` file** containing a detailed explanation of the process followed in the importing, cleaning, manipulation, and exporting of your data as well as my results, obstacles encountered, and lessons learned.



The goal of this project is to combine everything you have learned about data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation with Pandas so you can see how it all works together. For this project, you will start with this messy data set [Shark Attack](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks/version/1). You will need to import it, use your data wrangling skills to clean it up, prepare it to be analyzed, and then export it as a clean CSV data file.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping you as you go. Show us what you've got!
